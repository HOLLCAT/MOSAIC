    "description": "Microglial endolysosomal dysfunction is strongly implicated in neurodegeneration. Transcriptomic studies show that a microglial state characterised by a set of genes involved in endolysosomal function is induced in both mouse Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) models and in human AD brain, and that the onset of this state is emphasised in females. Cst7 (Cystatin F) is among the most highly unregulated genes in these microglia. However, the sex-specific function of Cst7 in neurodegenerative disease is not understood. Here, we crossed Cst7 -/- mice with the App NL-G-F mouse to test the role of Cst7 in a model of amyloid-driven AD.",

To study how mouse skin changes upon exposure to a carcinogen, we performed a classical two-stage skin carcinogenesis experiment, wherein cancer is initiated by a single application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene (DMBA) followed by repeated treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to drive cell proliferation. After 10 weeks, full thickness skin biopsies were collected and used to generate single cell transcriptomes (treatment samples).",

In previous experiments, subpopulations of primary B cells with different phenotypes were observed. Therefore, the next step is to further characterize these subpopulations of B cells via single-cell RNA sequencing so that we gain insight about cell characteristics and individual gene markers, and their potential biological role. Our hypothesis is that these cells present different expression profiles of key genes and/or are relevant in different immune-related pathways.",

These mice were injected with cerulein to promote the development of pancreatitis (cerulein dosage= 50Î¼g/kg). Cerulein was injected at 8 hourly intervals for 2 days in total. The first injection day was when mice reached their sixth week of age and the second injection day was 3 days after the first injection day. Both KC and KNeC mice developed PanINs. At the age of 10 months, pancreata of KC and KNeC mice were analyzed. Using laser capture microdissection, PanINs from both groups were excised and their transcriptome was analyzed though RNA-seq.",

    "description": "Endostatin is a naturally occurring 183-amino acid proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII that localizes in the basement membrane around blood vessels. The anti-tumor properties of this protein have been extensively described, demarcating endostatin as an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. Further, it suppresses many signaling cascades such as pro-inflammatory NF-ÎºB, coagulation, and adhesion cascades. Yamaguchi et al. reported that endostatin via its C-terminal domain (E4 peptide) has elicited anti-fibrosis effects. However, the zinc-binding domain has been previously confined to the N terminus (endostatin mP1 peptide) and was critical to numerous functions of the molecule. The present study aimed to better understand the impact of oligomerization (Fc-Endostatin) as well as N- vs. C-terminal fragments of endostatin (mP1, CE4) on modulating radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Mice were treated with Fc-endostatin (Fc-Endo), N-terminus endostatin peptide (mP1), or C-terminus endostatin E4 peptide (CE4) combined with photon 20 Gy or carbon-ions 12.5 Gy whole thoracic irradiation.",
